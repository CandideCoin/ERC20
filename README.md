# ERC20

Candide Coin or CCC is our foundational token that allows buyers to hold thousands, millions, or even tens of millions of it in their wallets. 

The main purpose of Candide Coin is to raise funds for charity through a small buy and sell tax on each transaction (8% buytax 12% sell tax). The funds raised will be donated to help populations affected by war  cashing out the CCC tokens in stablecoins in favor of this humanitarian purpose.
